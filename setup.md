# Setup with Consul
1. Consul must be configured with ACL enabled, and TLS configured.
2. Set up vault as a service. For this setup I had every node running a vault server(for future High Availability setup). I had the most success with *very* minimal .service file
    ```
    file contents here
    ```
3. For minimal setup, create the "listener" and "storage" stanzas in the *.hcl config file
    ```HCL
    file contents here
    ```
4. Once the service is running, you can initialize the vault keys with 
    ```Bash
    vault operator init
    ```
    This will generate an initial root token, and by default, 5 unseal keys, with 3 required to unseal the vault. Furthermore, this command is extremely configurable, the [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/init) has extensive details on what can be done with this
5. Hashicorp is a big fan of storing keys/certs in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in config files(though im sure they *can* be put in config files, hopefully ill fill in more details later)
    ```Bash
    export VAULT_CACERT=/path/to/pub_cacert.pem
    export VAULT_TOKEN=<token>
    ```
    The \<token\> above is intended to be the root token generated by command from #4
6. do this later
